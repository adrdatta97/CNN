# Convolutional Neural Network 

<h3> "I dream of painting and then I paint my dream." - Vincent Van Gogh" </h3>

Discovering the fascinating realm of deep learning algorithms to unleash the power of computer vision techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), to tackle intricate image classification tasks, uncovering effective strategies like transfer learning, fine-tuning, and augmented data, amplifying recognition performance.

<h3> Inspiration: </h3>
Our goal was to create a model that learn to identify the artist analysing new pictures with a hope to learn new techniques from public kernels or see some interesting usage of this data.
